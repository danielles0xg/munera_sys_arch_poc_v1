# WHY THIS POC IS JUSTIFIED

## 1. The Math Works
- 24-month investment: **$1.5M** (platform costs only $291K after credits)
- Built Technologies comparable: **$1.5B valuation** on $289M raised
- Canadian construction market: **$272B** with zero incumbents
- Prompt payment regulatory deadline: **7 months away**

## 2. Each Phase Delivers Standalone Value
- **P0-P1**: A working multi-tenant SaaS (valuable alone)
- **P2**: AI document processing (sellable as standalone service)
- **P3**: Lender draw management (the core product for investor's workflow)
- **P4**: Compliance engine (regulatory moat, no competitor has this)
- **P5**: BIM + AI (the differentiator vs. Built/Rabbet/TIMVERO)
- **P6**: Integrations (ecosystem play, network effects)
- **P7-P8**: Validation + production (proof + scale)

## 3. Risk Is Managed
- Parallel shadow deployment (P7) before replacing manual process
- HITL maintains professional liability coverage
- SOC 2 runs parallel to development
- Cloud costs near-zero Year 1 (Google for Startups credits) — talent is the real investment
- Government co-funding reduces effective out-of-pocket to ~$0-$200K

## 4. 80.6% Goes to People
The investor's money builds a **team**, not infrastructure. Every dollar of platform cost is optimized (Hetzner over AWS, Gemini Flash over GPT-4, pgvector over Pinecone). The remaining **$1.21M** is pure engineering capacity — the asset that creates defensible IP.
