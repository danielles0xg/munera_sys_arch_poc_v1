# P7: PILOT/VALIDATION (Months 8-10)

## What Gets Built
Deploy on 2-3 live construction projects. Run shadow mode (Munera parallel to manual process). Pen test. Performance optimization.

## Components

| Component | Description | Why It's Needed |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| **Shadow Deployment** | Munera processes same draw requests in parallel with manual process | Proves accuracy. Identifies gaps. Builds confidence before go-live. |
| **Penetration Testing** | External pen test by certified firm | Required for SOC 2. Identifies vulnerabilities before production data. |
| **Load Testing** | Simulate 100+ concurrent users, 1000+ documents/day | Ensure platform handles real production load. |
| **User Training** | Train QS analysts on the platform | Adoption is the bottleneck. Training is the solution. |
| **Feedback Loop** | Analyst corrections feed back into AI training pipeline | HITL corrections improve model accuracy over time. |
| **Performance Baselines** | Measure: time per report (before/after), accuracy, user satisfaction | Evidence for the investor. Proof that 4x productivity is real. |
